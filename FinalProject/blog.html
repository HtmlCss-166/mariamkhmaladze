                    <p>Painted furniture has a long and rich history that dates back centuries.
                         The earliest examples of painted furniture can be found in ancient Egyptian tombs,
                          where furniture was painted with intricate designs and bright colours to
                           show off the wealth and status of the owner.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text2">
                    <p>
                        In ancient Greece and Rome, painted furniture was also popular,
                         with intricate patterns and motifs painted onto furniture pieces using a 
                         variety of materials, including gold and silver leaf.
                         During the Middle Ages, painted furniture became less popular as people began to
                          focus on functional rather than decorative pieces. It wasn't until the Baroque period, 
                          in the 17th and 18th centuries, that painted furniture once again became fashionable. 
                          During this time, furniture was often painted with intricate designs and patterns, 
                          and gilded with gold or silver leaf.

                    <p>
                        In the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted furniture became even more popular, 
                        with a variety of styles and techniques being used. One popular style was the "painted lady,"
                         which involved painting furniture in a variety of bright colours, often with floral or other decorative patterns.
                          Another popular style was the "shabby chic" look, which involved painting furniture in a distressed or worn-looking
                           style to give it an antique appearance.
                     Today, painted furniture is still popular, with many people choosing to paint their own furniture at home as a DIY project.
                      One company that has recently entered the market with a range of high-quality paints specifically designed for furniture is Fusion Mineral Paint.
                     Fusion Mineral Paint: A Game-Changer in the World of Furniture Painting
                     Fusion Mineral Paint is a Canadian company that has quickly gained a reputation as a leader in the world of furniture painting.
                      Their paints are specially formulated to be easy to use and to provide long-lasting results, making them a favourite among DIYers 
                      and professional furniture painters alike.
                     One of the things that sets Fusion Mineral Paint apart from other furniture paints is its durability. The paint is highly resistant to
                      chipping, peeling, and fading, so it will keep your furniture looking fresh and new for years to come. It's also easy to clean, so you won't
                       have to worry about maintaining your painted pieces.
                     In addition to its durability, Fusion Mineral Paint is also known for its wide range of colours. The company offers over 60 different shades,
                      ranging from classic neutrals to bold, bright hues. This means you'll be able to find the perfect colour to match any style or decor.

                     to achieve this look. For a classic antique look, try pairing Fusion Mineral Paint's "Heritage" colour with "Coal Black" or "Midnight Blue."
                      For a more modern take on antique style, try pairing "Farmhouse Red" with "Dove White" or "Coastal Blue."
